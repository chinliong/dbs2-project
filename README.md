## ProDr Clinic Management Systems | Database Systems  
**Duration:** Sep 2024 â€“ Nov 2024  

### Project Overview  
ProDr is an enhanced version of the Clinic Management System, redesigned to migrate from **MariaDB** to **MongoDB**. The goal was to improve flexibility and scalability in managing patient records, appointments, and medication inventory.  

### Contributions  
- Fixed compatibility issues in original features (**Medication List**, **Search**, **Quantity Management**, **Add/Delete Medications**) that arose during the transition from MariaDB to MongoDB.  
- Enhanced the **search functionality** by adding a dropdown filter for faster and more accurate medication queries.  
- Ensured seamless integration between the **Flask backend** and **MongoDB**, preserving data consistency and user experience after migration.  

### Lessons Learned  
- Gained practical experience migrating from **relational** to **NoSQL** databases, including schema adaptation and query refactoring.  
- Improved debugging skills for solving cross-database compatibility challenges.  
- Learned to design more user-friendly query interfaces, such as dropdown search filters, to improve usability.  
- Developed a deeper understanding of trade-offs between **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases in scalability, flexibility, and query design.
